# LinuxPatcher
A simple to use application designed to fix problems in applications on Linux I find particularly annoying, including:
* Certificate errors on some networks
* LibreWolf not showing Google
* with more coming soon!

## Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/techguy16/LinuxPatcher ~/LinuxPatcher
cd ~/LinuxPatcher
chmod +x gui
./gui
```

**To launch LinuxPatcher again:**
```bash
~/LinuxPatcher/gui
```
